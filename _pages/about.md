I’m Amidu Dabor, a results-driven Software & AI/ML Engineer with over 3 years of hands-on experience in telecommunications IT, ICT-based training, and backend systems. My expertise spans generative AI, data science, cloud computing (Azure, AWS, & Modal), and full-stack development (backend-focused), with proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, LangChain, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern DevOps tools.

I’m passionate about building ethical, scalable software that solves real-world problems. Whether it's developing AI-driven applications, automating workflows, or enabling data-driven decision-making, I bring technical depth, cross-functional collaboration, and a strong commitment to continuous learning.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy creative writing, exploring emerging technologies, and learning from industry-leading research and communities. Let's connect and build something impactful.
