  <p>Iâ€™m <strong>Amidu Dabor</strong>, a Software and AI/ML Engineer engaged in building intelligent, ethical, and scalable systems that solve real-world problems. I recently <strong>concluded my Master of Science in Information Systems and Technology</strong> (Software Engineering concentration) at <strong>United States International University - Africa (USIU-Africa)</strong>, where I focused extensively on <strong>Artificial Intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs), and intelligent agent systems</strong>.</p>

  <p>My thesis centered on the <strong>design and evaluation of an academic AI assistant</strong>, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), adaptive multi-agent collaboration, advanced prompt engineering, and serverless infrastructure to provide contextualized, intelligent academic support.</p>

  <p>With over <strong>3 years of applied experience</strong>, I have contributed to and led high-impact solutions in AI, backend systems, and cloud-native platforms across academia, telecoms, and innovation ecosystems. I bring a rare blend of <strong>strong software engineering, data-centric thinking, and the ability to work independently or collaboratively</strong>, always driving toward results and quality.</p>
